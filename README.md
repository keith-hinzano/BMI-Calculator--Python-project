# BMI-Calculator--Python-project

This BMI (Body Mass Index) Calculator is a simple Python project that calculates a user's BMI based on their weight (in pounds) and height (in inches). The user inputs their name, weight, and height, and the program computes their BMI using the standard formula:

𝐵𝑀𝐼 = (Weight X 703) / height X height

​The program then provides feedback on the user's health category based on their BMI value. The categories include underweight, normal weight, overweight, obese, severely obese, and morbidly obese. It also handles invalid input scenarios, prompting the user to enter valid data. This project demonstrates basic Python programming concepts like user input, conditionals, and mathematical operations.
